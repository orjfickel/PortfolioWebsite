MCMC Decorrelation of ReSTIR</h2>


    <v-row class="d-flex mb-auto">
      <v-col cols="auto" md="" class="d-flex text-justify"><span> The slides above were used for my thesis defense and should provide an overview
        of the concepts involved in my thesis and its results.
        The <a target="_blank" href="https://studenttheses.uu.nl/handle/20.500.12932/45244">full thesis</a> as well as
        the <a target="_blank" href="https://git.science.uu.nl/vig/mscprojects/blue-noise-distributed-mcmc-decorrelation-of-restir">source code</a> have been made publicly available.
        <br>
        My master's thesis was twofold in its contribution.
        Using the code for <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DQLin/ReSTIR_PT">ReSTIR PT</a> as basis,
          I (re)implemented the <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2211.00166">paper by Sawhney et al.</a>
          on adding MCMC mutations to decorrelate ReSTIR PT.
In addition to this, I modified the acceptance probability to optimise for blue noise.
The effects of this were marginal, but I was able provide reasoning as to how, in hindsight, this is actually an expected result.

<br> See the accompanying video for a demonstration of the reduction in correlation artifacts
  in the form of bright streaks across the ceiling.

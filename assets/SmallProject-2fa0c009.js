This project was performed during my masters, being equivalent to following two courses and taking up 10 weeks of full time work. It involved developing a program that uses a sort of per-triangle photon counting to compute the UV doses received by the surfaces of a hospital room, given a number of positions and durations for a UV light. This program was meant to be used by researchers working with ZorgSaam hospital to more efficiently figure out the optimal placement of a simple robot fitted with a UV light, such that the room is sufficiently decontaminated. In addition to this, the program helped gain a visual perspective of how this UV light placement affects how the UV doses are spread out in the room.
